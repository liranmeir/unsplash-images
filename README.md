This project is part of mixtiels homework assignment

Please construct a web page with four black frames, and a refresh button below it.

When the page loads, it randomly chooses 4 photos from unsplash api and loads them.

Tapping refresh selects 4 new random images instead.

Use react create app, without using redux.

Please try to make the page look and feel the best you can.

We do not give a reference design except for the frame, so use your internal talent.
